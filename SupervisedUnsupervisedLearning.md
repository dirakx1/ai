Learn input to output algorithms. 

They give the right answer. 
Examples:
* spam filtering
* Speech recognition
* Machine translation 
* online advertising 
* Self driving car 
* visual inspection 

Training the model for input/output
they read functions like regressions (pedict a number for infinite numbers) 
Also they deal with classification. 
labeled data
### Regression
* Linear regression model (give data to your model , supervised learning model)+
* infinite outputs

#### Linear Regression
* Price of houses vs size
* provides right answer
* univariate linnear regression
#### Cost function
* A linear function of the type f = wx + b (w, b parameters or weights)
* the goal is to minimize that cost function (this is done via gradient descent)

#### Multiple features
* multiple Xs (variables) X1 X2..Xy.
* vectors
* multiple linear regression
* Scalling of features (or x)
* Gradient decent. 
  
### Classification
* Types of breast tumors (benigne or malignant) 
* types of photos (cat or dogs)
* Categorization (small number of outputs or discrete)
  
#### Logical regression algorithm (used for calssification, dont be confused by the name)
* new cost function (with loss)
* new gradient descent

#### Notation
* Training data set
* x (input or features)
* y (output or targets)

#### Underfit / overfit 
* problems with algoritms. that dont generalize well
* To avoid there are many techniques like having more data, selecting fetures or inputs.
* Regularization of inputs: make w3 .. wn polinomials small 

## Unsupervised learning
* find pattern on not labeled data
* clusters data algoritm
* anomaly detection
* dimensionality reduction
* 
### Examples
* google news, cluster of similar news 
* DNW microarray data .. clustering people with certaing genes. 
* grouping types of customers
