Learn input to output algorithms. 

They give the right answer. 
Examples:
* spam filtering
* Speech recognition
* Machine translation 
* online advertising 
* Self driving car. 
* visual inspection 

Training the model for input/output
they read functions like regressions (pedict a number for infinite numbers) 
Also they deal with classification. 
labeled data
### Regression
### Classification
* Types of breast tumors (benigne or malignant) 
* types of photos (cat or dogs)

## Unsupervised learning
* find pattern on not labeled data
* clusters data algoritm
* anomaly detection
* dimensionality reduction
* 
### Example
* google news, cluster of similar news 
* DNW microarray data .. clustering people with certaing genes. 
* grouping types of customers
