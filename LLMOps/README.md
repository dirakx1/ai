It comes from MLOPs framework

* Automation, orchestrestation
  
* Mllops for LLMs (LLMops) is different than LLM system design
## LLMops: 
* experimenting FM,
* prompt desing and management,
* supervised-tunning,
* monitoring,
* evaluation

## LLM system desing: 
* Chainnig LLMs,
* grounding (make sure that LLM has the relevant information for the output that you desired),
* track history
* Model customization: data prep, tunning, evaluate.
## LLmops pipeline
* Data preparation and versioning --- Pipeline desing (supervised tunning) --- Artifact (file with configuration and workflow) --- then pipeline execution - deploy llms -- propmting and predictions --- responsible aI (check the repsonse) 
 * Key concepts: Orquestration (step by step definition) and automation
