# Machine learning
## Deep learning components :
### Generative AI (subset of deep learning)
#### ANN: artificial neural network
#### CNN: Convoluted neural network
#### RNN: Recurrent neural network (short time memory) 
#### RL: Reinforcement learnin
#### GAN: Generative Adversarial network  -- Generative AI  Text 2 image, Text 2 text.
#### LLM: large lenguaje model            -- Generative AI  Image 2 text, image 2 image.

# Notes
## Seq data arch
* RNN: Recurrent neural network (short time memory)  ---  Old AI arch sequence data
* lstm short to long memory                          ---  Old AI arch sequence data
* GRU advace LSTM                                    ---  Old AI arch sequence data
## Encoder - decoder arch
* Enconder (rnn,  lstm, gru) - decoder (rnn,  lstm, gru) arch seq to seq.
## Transformer arch (attention all you need,embedding attention)
* encoder (LLM) - decoder but with embeddings
